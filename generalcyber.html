                  <p>Using unique passwords for each account encrypting passwords as well as obfuscating passwords to a high level of security this is one of the ways of preventing and ensuring your accounts are not at risk by preventing you from reusing one password which if compromised would in turn lead to the rest of your accounts also compromised this reduces the risk of the domino effect.
                    Improving password security involves using techniques like salting and hashing. Salting adds random data to each password before hashing, making it harder for attackers to use precomputed tables like rainbow tables. Hashing algorithms also make passwords nearly impossible to crack through brute force attacks.

       <h3 class="coolText">Authentication, Email, Updating Software :</h3>
        <p>Enabling 2fa authentication via text/email 2FA adds an extra layer of security by requiring both a password and possession of the user's phone or email account. This makes it much harder for attackers to gain unauthorized access.
          Text/email-based 2FA is widely supported by online services, making it easily accessible to users. Since most people have a phone or email account, this verification method can be seamlessly integrated without the need for extra hardware or software.
          Updating software applications operating systems anti-virus programs on a regular basis. cyber attackers exploit software weaknesses for various attacks like malware infections, data breaches, and system compromises. Updating software is crucial to safeguard against these exploits by addressing vulnerabilities.
       Cybersecurity risks evolve constantly as hackers develop new tactics. Regular software updates can help protect against emerging threats by ensuring your systems have the latest security features.
       Regularly backing up data is crucial to prevent the loss of important information. Maintaining current backups reduces the risk of data loss from hardware issues, accidental deletions, malware attacks, or unexpected events. Backups enable data recovery in case of inaccessibility or corruption, minimizing negative impacts on professional activities or personal projects.
  </p>
  
  <h4 class="coolText">Ransomware and WIFI :</h4>
  <p>Ransomware attacks pose a significant threat by encrypting data and demanding payment for decryption keys. However, maintaining current backups allows you to restore data without giving in to ransom demands, reducing financial impact and avoiding support for illicit activities associated with these attacks.

    Using public wi-fi without proper measures (VPN) Public Wi-Fi networks are often insecure, making them vulnerable to cyber threats. Hackers can intercept traffic, eavesdrop on communications, and steal sensitive information like passwords, financial data, and personal details.
    Attackers can create fake Wi-Fi hotspots with convincing names such as "FreeWiFi" to trick users into connecting. Using a VPN encrypts connections and verifies authenticity, reducing the risk of falling victim to network spoofing.
