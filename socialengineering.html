                  <h2 class="coolText"> What is social engineering</h2>
                <p>In cybersecurity, social engineering is the term used to describe the misleading of people in order to obtain sensitive data or systems. Social engineering is an alternative to typical hacking techniques, which only target technical weaknesses. Instead, it takes advantage of human psychology and behaviour. This tactic frequently entails misleading or manipulating individuals into disclosing private information and granting unauthorised access. </p>

       <h3 class="coolText"> Phising and Pretexting</h3>
       <p>Phishing is a popular type of social engineering in which perpetrators send phoney emails or messages claiming to be reputable companies like banks, governments, or well-known organisations. Usually, these emails have files or links that, when clicked or opened, download malware or take users to phoney websites intended to steal credit card numbers or login credentials.</p>
        <p>Pretexting is another common social engineering technique in which attackers make a situation to coerce victims into divulging personal information or carrying out specific tasks. An attacker could, for instance, contact a worker pretending to be an IT specialist and asking for their login information in order to upgrade the system. Without raising red flags, the attacker can gain sensitive information by taking advantage of the target's trust and willingness to assist.</p>
       <p>Furthermore, physical social engineering refers to the use of social engineering approaches to in person interactions in addition to digital channels. This could entail using strategies like tailgating—following an authorised individual into a restricted area—or assuming the identity of a delivery person to get inside a guarded building. Through the use of human inclinations to trust and help others, attackers can circumvent physical security measures and enter restricted areas without authorization.</p>
        <h4 class="coolText"> How organisations can be made aware of it</h4>
       <p>Organisations must put in place thorough security awareness training programmes to teach staff members about typical strategies and how to spot and handle suspicious requests in order to reduce the danger of social engineering attacks. Even in the event that credentials are compromised, strong authentication methods like multi-factor authentication can aid in preventing unwanted access. Frequent penetration tests and security assessments can also assist in finding vulnerabilities and addressing them before social engineers can take advantage of them.</p>
