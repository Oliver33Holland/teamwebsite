                  <p>Firewalls act as a protective barrier between your internal network and external networks, like the internet. By filtering incoming and outgoing traffic, they play a crucial role in safeguarding your network from unauthorized access, cyber-attacks, and risks.
                    Firewalls can customize online content filtration based on criteria like website categories, URLs, and keywords. This helps organizations enforce acceptable use policies, restrict access to harmful sites, and reduce the risk of encountering malicious content.
                    </p>
                    <p>By monitoring network traffic at the application layer, these firewalls can detect and prevent malicious or unauthorized actions that may bypass standard network layer firewalls. This includes advanced attacks like SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and command injection, which exploit vulnerabilities in application-level protocols.</p>
                    <p>NGFWs can integrate threat intelligence data from external sources like security vendors, research organizations, and global networks to detect known malicious IP addresses, domains, and signatures for proactive threat prevention and response.</p>

       <p>Malware infections can compromise the security and reliability of endpoint devices, leading to unauthorized access, data loss, and system instability. Antivirus programs help prevent system vulnerabilities by detecting and removing malware risks before they can exploit weaknesses and jeopardize device security.</p>
       <p>Real-time scanning allows antivirus software to quickly detect and respond to security threats by isolating or deleting harmful files, processes, or network connections, helping to contain incidents and prevent further compromise or data breaches.</p>
       <p>Antivirus software uses heuristic analysis to detect and classify new or zero-day threats without recognizable signatures. By examining file attributes and actions, heuristic analysis can identify suspicious files or behaviours with potentially harmful characteristics, even if they are unknown.</p>
